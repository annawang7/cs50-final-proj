# That's A Mood: A CS50 Project

**[That's A Mood](https://annawang7.github.io/cs50-final-proj)** is a project to encourage an open expression of mental health on the Harvard campus. 

## Why is this important?
  Mental health is a term that addresses our social, emotional, and psychological well-being, and constantly affects how we think, feel, and act. It is an incredibly important aspect of daily life, yet too often mental health problems are ignored or stigmatized in present-day culture.
  
  A poll conducted in 2009 by the American Psychological Association concluded that 75% of adults report moderate to high levels of stress. However, the stigma around mental illnesses is still highly prominent and impedes access to treatment or help around the issue.

  By displaying the Harvard community's mental state in an open, yet anonymous environment, we can encourage the normalization of discussion of mental health in our community. That's A Mood encourages a constant dialogue about moods and mental health in a visual, physical environment. 

## Inputting a Mood
  **[That's A Mood](https://annawang7.github.io/cs50-final-proj)** is a static Jekyll website that currently hosts the input method for the That's A Mood project.
  
  Selecting your color on a given color wheel, which corresponds to an emotion. Based on mood-to-color relational studies, an algorithm maps a chosen color to a specific mood as a way to visually represent one's mental state.
  
  Once they hit submit, the color selected on the wheel is sent through a series of pipelines to eventually interact with the LEDs, and add the new input to our hardware project.

## Background
![Color Wheel](https://github.com/annawang7/cs50-final-proj/blob/gh-pages/Color_Wheel.jpg "Source: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/peaceful-parents-happy-kids/201801/easy-ways-teach-kids-about-emotions-in-daily-life?amp")

Our moods are often mercurial and shaped by our surroundings, especially by color. Colors like green and blue are viewed as more calming colors, while colors like red and yellow may excite or even agitate us. Similarly, colors can often be a reflection of how we currently feel. Thus began That's A Mood: a colorful exploration to reveal how we--as a campus--are feeling.

Using the six mood divisions in the color wheel above with some modifications, we mapped each of the colors to an RGB range that users can input.
